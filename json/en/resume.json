        "summary": "Speech recognition is an input system that consists of a microphone and speech recognition software. Speech recognition software is complex. Sounds received via a microphone must be broken down into phonemes; then, a “best guess” algorithm is used to match phonemes and syllables to a database of possible words. To solve speech inconsistencies like accent, volume, pitch, and inflection, male vs. female, sarcasm, and colloquialisms, the software must examine context and word patterns to determine the correct meaning. This requires an enormous database, which in turn requires a computer with very capable processing speed and memory. Speech recognition will greatly change the way information is input. Ease, convenience, and speed are three advantages to using a microphone instead of a keyboard. Speech recognition technology will have an impact on all careers but especially education. Business Education teachers must stay abreast of this technology and be willing to adjust their courses to best prepare students."
